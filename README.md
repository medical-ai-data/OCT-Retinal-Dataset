## Retinal-OCT-Clinical-Dataset

The Retinal-OCT-Clinical-Dataset is a collection of clinically acquired retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images intended to support research in automated retinal disease classification and medical imaging AI.

The dataset includes multiple retinal conditions:
- Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
- Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)
- Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment (RRD)
- Healthy/Normal cases

### Data Access

Due to patient confidentiality, institutional regulations, and ethical approval constraints, the dataset is distributed under controlled access conditions.

Researchers interested in accessing the dataset for non-commercial scientific purposes may request access via the official Zenodo repository:

DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18725274.  

Access requests are evaluated to ensure compliance with ethical and data protection requirements.
The Data Agreement is available on the project GitHub repository.
Applicants must download the agreement, sign it, and send it by email.
After approval, download access will be granted.

### Intended Use

This dataset is suitable for:
- Training and evaluation of deep learning models for retinal disease detection
- Multi-class classification benchmarking
- Research on medical image analysis and clinical AI
